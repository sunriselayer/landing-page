	"glosarry-2": "<b>Blob / Blobspace:</b> “Blobs” are large chunks of data handled separately from typical on-chain transactions to reduce congestion. “Blobspace” is the dedicated capacity for these data chunks, allowing for bigger, more flexible data storage.",
	"glosarry-3": "<b>Liquidity Fragmentation:</b> When crypto assets are split across multiple platforms, access to large, unified liquidity pools becomes difficult, increasing trading costs and complexity.",
	"glosarry-4": "<b>Proof of Liquidity (PoL):</b> Proof of Liquidity (PoL) is a novel consensus mechanism that strengthens a chain’s security by requiring participants to provide on-chain liquidity.",
	"glosarry-5": "<b>Fee Abstraction:</b> The ability to pay for network services (like storing data) with multiple kinds of assets, rather than one specific token. It simplifies costs by letting participants contribute liquidity in whatever form suits them best.",
	"glosarry-6": "<b>Rollup/L2:</b> A second-layer protocol built on top of a main blockchain to handle more transactions at lower costs. Rollups batch or execute transactions off the main chain while still relying on it for security or final settlement. Optimism and Arbitrum are well known examples."
