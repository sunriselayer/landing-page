This bootstraps liquidity for rollups, while providing a comprehensive solution for modular blockchain development.",
	"sunrise-1": {
		"label": "Modular Blockchain Structures",
		"description": "A modular blockchain differs from a monolithic chain in that at least one of its four main functions has been offloaded to a separate layer. In the current infrastructure landscape, modular solutions have become the preeminent method for blockchain development.<br><br>Sunrise provides a fast, secure data availability and consensus layer for scalable modular blockchains, while allowing individual networks to determine their own customized execution and settlement layers.<br><br>By using this structure, modular blockchains are more efficient, customizable, scalable, and sovereign."
	},
	"sunrise-2": {
		"label": "Proof of Liquidity",
		"description": "Sunrise brings further innovation to modular blockchain structures by directly integrating Proof of Liquidity (PoL), which enables modular liquidity, and resolves the liquidity issue faced by new rollup developers.<br><br>Extending & replicating Berachain Proof of Liquidity across the entire DA Layer creates an aligned liquidity & security model similar to Berachain’s PoL flywheel, systematically building liquidity for both Sunrise and its users.<br><br>DA users on Sunrise can now directly engage in PoL on Sunrise to bootstrap liquidity and security for their rollup."
	},
	"sunrise-3": {
		"label": "Fee Abstraction and LP Benefits",
		"description": "Integrating PoL at the DA Layer also enables Fee Abstraction on Sunrise. While other DA layers charge fees in their native tokens, leading to a net-value extract to rollup developers, Sunrise instead rewards liquidity provision with blobspace. <br><br>Sunrise resolves singular token dependency by allowing any liquidity pool to apply to become whitelisted for PoL emissions; such that any token with a rich, deep liquidity pool will automatically earn more rewards and more blobspace. <br><br>Users can LP to any pool of their choice, including stable pools, settlement layer tokens, and bridged tokens through our cross-chain integrations. This allows Sunrise and Sunrise’s users to become secured by liquidity from many various ecosystems. Together, these unique functions supercharge Data Availability for developers."

	"sunrise-4": {
		"label": "Off-Chain Blobs and Data Storage",
		"description": "Sunrise has been designed from the ground-up to enable higher throughput data availability through the use of off-chain blobs. Sunrise’s blob module allows for larger block sizes, enabling new experimentation in DA usage such as fully-onchain AI, gaming, and more.<br><br>Off-chain blobs also provide optionality for native data retrievability and controllable retrievability periods, thus ensuring both immediate data availability and permanent storage solutions."
