	"sunrise-definition": "Sunrise integrates Data Availability layer and Liquidity Hub functions into a single platform powered by <br class='hidden md:block'>Proof-of-Liquidity — enabling sovereign rollups and leading L1s like Ethereum and Solana to connect <br class='hidden md:block'>seamlessly through deep, shared liquidity.",
	"sunrise-1": {
		"label": "Proof of Liquidity",
		"description": "Sunrise brings further innovation to modular blockchain structures by directly integrating Proof of Liquidity (PoL), which enables modular liquidity, and resolves the liquidity and security issues faced by new rollup developers.<br><br>Through Sunrise’s native DEX, rollups can immediately tap into deep shared liquidity and route assets across ecosystems without building fragmented infrastructure or bridges.<br><br>This unified model bootstraps both liquidity and security the moment a rollup launches. By driving real trading volume, rollups can grow their native token liquidity and attract vRISE gauge allocations - aligning incentives with real usage and compounding ecosystem value over time."
	},
	"sunrise-2": {
		"label": "ZKP-based Interoperability",
		"description": "The era where Web2-like applications seamlessly interact with public blockchains is just around the corner. Powered by rollups built on Sunrise, these apps offer the familiar user experience of traditional web platforms—while behind the scenes they leverage zero-knowledge proofs and IBC to connect trustlessly with ecosystems like Sunrise, Ethereum, and Solana.<br><br>Sunrise is the first blockchain to fuse proven IBC interoperability with ZKP validation, enabling scalable, secure, and interoperable rollups by design."
	},
	"sunrise-3": {
		"label": "Fee Abstraction and LP Benefits",
		"description": "Integrating PoL at the DA Layer also enables Fee Abstraction on Sunrise. While other DA layers charge fees in their native tokens, leading to a net-value extract to rollup developers, Sunrise instead rewards liquidity provision with blobspace. <br><br>Sunrise resolves singular token dependency by allowing any liquidity pool to apply to become whitelisted for PoL emissions; such that any token with a rich, deep liquidity pool will automatically earn more rewards and more blobspace. <br><br>Users can LP to any pool of their choice, including stable pools, settlement layer tokens, and bridged tokens through our cross-chain integrations. This allows Sunrise and Sunrise’s users to become secured by liquidity from many various ecosystems. Together, these unique functions supercharge Data Availability for developers."

	"sunrise-4": {
		"label": "Off-Chain Blobs and Data Storage",
		"description": "Sunrise keeps full blob data off-chain, anchoring only a Merkle root on-chain to keep blocks lean. Blob payloads travel over a dedicated P2P network and reach full availability in under two blocks (≈14 s), even for multi-MB batches.<br><br>You control retention: nodes can fetch blobs on demand or prune old data, so you balance local storage with your app’s needs—from short-term proofs to long-term audit trails."
