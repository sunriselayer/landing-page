		"description": "Smart contract such as those built on Ethereum’s OP Stack, rely on a base chain for security, transaction ordering, and final settlement. This approach allows developers and users to benefit from the parent chain’s established network, existing tools, and active liquidity.<br><br>However, using a parent chain’s infrastructure also means following its rules, fee market, and upgrade schedule."

		"description": "Sovereign rollups depend only on a data availability layer, like Sunrise, and do not settle on an L1. Without an external chain’s constraints, developers gain more freedom to define their own rules, fee models, and governance processes.<br><br>Sovereign rollups can adopt advanced features—like custom consensus or execution layers, novel consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Liquidity), privacy through zero-knowledge proofs, and even AI-driven automation."
